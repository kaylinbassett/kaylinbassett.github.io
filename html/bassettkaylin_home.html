            <p>
                I hope to connect with my family and create something to look back on for my future self. 
                For some reason my memory hasn't been the best lately, and this will serve as my way to remember 
                the little moments that we tend to lose to time.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is also the assignment for my final project- if you couldn't tell already,
                I have been working on this the whole semester!

            <h2>Howdy! Welcome to my Personal Blog</h2>
            <p>
                    Hello! I’m Kaylin Bassett. I’m making this website to serve as a personal journal to 
                document my life and the experiences I have during my semesters at Austin Community College.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prompted by my Web Design Class, Professor Manuel Duran is helping to guide me in expanding 
                and demonstrating my knowledge and skills regarding HTML and CSS web development, through this website. 
            </p>
            <p> In this website, you will find pictures I have taken that represent an experience I had, 
                a small description about said experiences, links to music, videos, or places that I feel 
                have added to, or contributed to the event. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope you enjoy taking a look around at my Fall 2023 experience!
            </p>
