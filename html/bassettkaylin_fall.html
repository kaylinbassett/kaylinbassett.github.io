                September 1st, 2023
            </p>
            <p>
                I met up with my sister, Lili with my mom during her lunch break! We got bored and started drawing on the wrappers.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was still really hot outside. No surprise for Texas.
            </p>

            <h3>Professor Onobajo</h3>

            </p>
            <p>
                This is at the ACC Round Rock Campus, with my UNIX Professor, Onobajo. I really enjoyed having him
            </p>
            <p>
                This campus is really beautiful, especially in the Fall.

                September 21th, 2023
            </p>
            <p>
                This is my boyfriend Vincent. We've been together for 4 years now. This picture was right after a date!
            </p>
            <p>
                He is my best friend and my favorite person in the World.

                October 4th, 2023
            </p>
            <p>
                I went to this coffee shop with my cousin Alexia, the drive was a really long one and I got scared on the way.
            </p>
            <p>
                The drinks were actually terrible, I even got another one to try and it was trash.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Foodtruck</h3>

                October 4th, 2023
            </p>
            <p>
                This was right outside the coffee shop, it was very aesthetic.
            </p>
            <p>
                We did not get food here, it was way overpriced.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                This was after my last class of the day and I wanted to capture how I looked at the moment.
            </p>
            <p>
                A little sweaty I would say.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Ring of Fire</h3>

            <p>
                I went with my boyfriend and his dad to San Antonio to see the full ring. They were as excited as little kids!
            </p>
            <p>
                This is when I discovered the joy of bread.. butter.. sugar.

            <p>
                This was my very first concert and I loved it! I was so excited to see him and I had 
                the best time with my sister there.
            </p>
            <p>
                My picture on the home page is from this same concert.

                After rock climbing at <a href="https://www.cruxclimbingcenter.com/" target="_blank">Crux</a> with my boyfriend, sister, and brother, we went across the street to get coffee and 
                this food! 
            </p>
            <p>
                It was super good, but I got full pretty fast.

            </p>
            <p>
                I went to Six Flags with my boyfriend and spent the whole day riding as many roller coasters as wel could.
                It was such an amazing day and much needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                I told my parents I was at work while doing this. They would've freaked out!
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                This was a little breakfast date with my boyfriend at Kerbey Lane. Their egg benedicts are the way to go.
            </p>
            <p>
                Definitely a go-to spot for me.

                My wrapped year for music! Super exciting as I had a bit of a country influence this year.
            </p>
            <p>
                Don't think Rap was the right genre for me but I guess.
